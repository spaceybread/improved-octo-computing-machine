every node has its own ids and ids of its direct connections (neighbors)

assumptions:
can directly ping anyone in your connected component mesh

1. how to find connected components:
distributed DFS algorithm:
FLAG COMPUTE CC: inititate CC computation
first node is the initializer
- add yourself to visited set and send this to unvisted neighbors, keep track of parent
- once initializer is done exploring:
FLAG UPDATE CC: flood/gossip the CC to the network


2. how to add nodes:
new connected component is the union of all neighbors and yourself. flood or gossip this new cc to everything using FLAG UPDATE CC or something

3. how to remove a node
when you disconnect, the neighbors run the DDFS to recompute their CC
